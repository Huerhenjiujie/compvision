Python-bioformats is a Python wrapper for Bio-Formats, a standalone
Java library for reading and writing life sciences image file
formats. Bio-Formats is capable of parsing both pixels and
metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to
several formats. Python-bioformats uses the python-javabridge to
start a Java virtual machine from Python and interact with
it. Python-bioformats was developed for and is used by the cell
image analysis software CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org).
